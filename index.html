  </p>

  <h2>6. How We Share Your Information</h2>
  <h3>6.1 Service Providers</h3>
  <p>
    We may share your information with trusted third-party vendors and service providers who perform tasks on our behalf and need access to such information to provide their services. Examples include hosting providers, analytics providers, and customer support services. These third-party providers are obligated not to disclose or use your information for any other purpose.
  </p>
  <h3>6.2 Business Transfers</h3>
  <p>
    If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will endeavor to ensure the confidentiality of any Personal Data involved in such transactions.

  </p>

  <h2>7. Cookies &amp; Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    We use cookies and similar technologies to collect usage data, remember user preferences, and enhance your experience. You can choose to disable cookies through your browser settings, but some features of our Service may not function properly without them.
  </p>

  <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to and maintained on servers located in countries outside of your jurisdiction where data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction. By using the Service, you consent to such transfers.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our Service is intended for students and users of various age groups. However, we expect users under the age of 13 (or the equivalent age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use the Service only with permission and supervision from a parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13 without parental consent, please contact us so that we can take appropriate measures to remove the data.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We employ reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your Personal Data. However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>
    The Service may contain links to third-party websites or applications that are not operated by us. We are not responsible for the content, privacy, or security practices of such third-party platforms. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party site or service that you visit.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
  <p>
    Some browsers may transmit “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals to websites. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret DNT signals, we do not currently respond to them. If a standard is established, we will revisit our policy.
  </p>

  <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
